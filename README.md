See [HELP.md](./companion/HELP.md) and [LICENSE](./LICENSE)

## Getting started
The module can be built once with `bun run build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.

While developing the module, by using `bun run dev` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.
